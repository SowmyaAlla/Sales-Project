# Sales-Project
I built a sales dashboard from scratch. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide an overview of sales performance. It allows the user to view month-on-month performance, select a single currency, and compare its performance to other currencies. The dashboard also enables users to analyze sales data based on three sections: Users, Currency, and Sales Territory.
